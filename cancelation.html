        <h2>Project Cancellations</h2>
        <p>
          Clients may request cancellation of a project at any point. However, once the work has commenced, the 50% advance payment is non-refundable due to resource allocation and time investment.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-block">
        <h2>Cancellation Before Project Start</h2>
        <p>
          If cancellation is requested before any work has begun, we will initiate a partial refund process after deducting any consultation or preparation fees already incurred.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-block">
        <h2>Missed Deadlines Due to Client Delays</h2>
        <p>
          If delays occur due to unresponsiveness or delay in sharing content from the client’s end, cancellation with refund is not applicable.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-block">
        <h2>Cancellation by the Service Provider</h2>
        <p>
          If we must cancel a project due to unavoidable circumstances, a full refund will be issued to the client within 7 business days.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="policy-block">
        <h2>Refund Processing</h2>
        <p>
          Refunds, where applicable, will be processed via the original mode of payment within 7-10 business days after approval.
